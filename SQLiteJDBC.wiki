= SQLite JDBC Driver =

SQLite JDBC driver developed by [wiki:leo Taro L. Saito] is an extension of [http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc Zentus's SQLite JDBC driver] that enables Java to access [https://www.sqlite.org SQLite] database files.

Our SQLiteJDBC library, developed as a part of [http://www.xerial.org Xerial project], requires no configuration since all native libraries for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and pure-java SQLite, which works in any OS environment, are assembled into a single JAR (Java Archive) file. The usage is quite simple; [#Download Download] our sqlite-jdbc library, then append the library (JAR file) to your class path. See [#Usage the sample code]. 

== What is different from Zentus's SQLite JDBC? ==

The original Zentus's SQLite JDBC driver http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/ itself is an excellent utility for using [https://www.sqlite.org SQLite] databases from Java language, and our SQLiteJDBC library also relies on its implementation. However, its pure-java version, which totally translates c/c++ codes of SQLite into Java, is significantly slower compared to its native version, which uses SQLite binaries compiled for each OS (win, mac, linux). 

To use the native version of sqlite-jdbc, user had to set a path to the native codes (dll, dylib, so files, which are JNDI C programs) by using command-line arguments, e.g., -Djava.library.path=(path to the dll, dylib, etc.), or -Dorg.sqlite.lib.path, etc. This process was error-prone and bothersome to tell every user to set these variables. Our SQLiteJDBC library completely does away these inconveniences.

Another difference is that we are keeping this SQLiteJDBC library up-to-date to the newest version of SQLite engine, because we are one of the hottest users of this library. For example, SQLite JDBC is a core component of [http://utgenome.org/ UTGB (University of Tokyo Genome Browser) Toolkit], which is our utility to create personalized genome browsers.

If you want to use the native library for your OS, [#BuildfromSource build the source from scratch].


== Usage ==

 1. Download sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar from [http://www.xerial.org/maven/repository/artifact/org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/], then append this jar file into your classpath. 
 1. load the JDBC driver org.sqlite.JDBC from your code. (see the example below)

 * Usage Example (Assuming sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar is placed in the current directory)
{{{
> javac Sample.java
> java -classpath ".;sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar" Sample   # in Windows
or 
> java -classpath ".:sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar" Sample   # in Mac or Linux
name = leo
id = 1
name = yui
id = 2
}}}
 * Sample.java
{{{
#!java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;


public class Sample
{
  public static void main(String[] args) throws ClassNotFoundException
  {
    // load the sqlite-JDBC driver using the current class loader
    Class.forName("org.sqlite.JDBC");
    
    Connection connection = null;
    try
    {
      // create a database connection
      connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:sample.db");
      Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
      statement.setQueryTimeout(30);  // set timeout to 30 sec.
      
      statement.executeUpdate("drop table if exists person");
      statement.executeUpdate("create table person (id integer, name string)");
      statement.executeUpdate("insert into person values(1, 'leo')");
      statement.executeUpdate("insert into person values(2, 'yui')");
      ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery("select * from person");
      while(rs.next())
      {
        // read the result set
        System.out.println("name = " + rs.getString("name"));
        System.out.println("id = " + rs.getInt("id"));
      }
    }
    catch(SQLException e)
    {
      // if the error message is "out of memory", 
      // it probably means no database file is found
      System.err.println(e.getMessage());
    }
    finally
    {
      try
      {
        if(connection != null)
          connection.close();
      }
      catch(SQLException e)
      {
        // connection close failed.
        System.err.println(e);
      }
    }
  }
}
}}}

The usage of SQLite-JDBC driver is the same with the original version. See http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/ for the general usage. For usage of JDBC, see  [http://www.xerial.org/trac/Xerial/wiki/WebApplication/JDBC my article] about JDBC.

== How to Specify Database Files ==
Here is an example to select a file C:\work\mydatabase.db (in Windows)
{{{
#!java
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:C:/work/mydatabase.db");
}}}

A UNIX (Linux, Mac OS X, etc) file /home/leo/work/mydatabase.db
{{{
#!java
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:/home/leo/work/mydatabase.db");
}}}

== How to Use Memory Databases ==
SQLite supports on-memory database management, which does not create any database files. To use a memory database in your Java code, get the database connection as follows:
{{{
#!java
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite::memory:");
}}}

== How to test the running mode: Native or Pure-Java Version? ==
{{{
#!java
import org.sqlite.SQLiteJDBCLoader;

// in your function ...
void test()
{
  System.out.println(String.format("running in %s mode", SQLiteJDBCLoader.isNativeMode() ? "native" : "pure-java"));
}


}}}

== Run in Pure-Java mode ==

In some OS (e.g., old Linux kernel), loading native library causes JVM crashes. In this case, set sqlite.purejava=true JVM variable:
{{{
 > java -Dsqlite.purejava=true -cp .:sqlite-jdbc-3.6.10.jar Sample
}}}

Or, set this System property before loading the JDBC driver:
{{{
  System.setProperty("sqlite.purejava", "true");
  Class.forName("org.sqlite.JDBC");
}}}

In this mode, sqlite-jdbc never uses native SQLite libraries.

== How to use Online Backup and Restore Feature ==

  * Take a backup of the whole database to "backup.db" file:
{{{
// Create a memory database
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:");
// Do some updates
stmt.executeUpdate("create table sample(id, name)");
stmt.executeUpdate("insert into sample values(1, \"leo\")");
stmt.executeUpdate("insert into sample values(2, \"yui\")");
// Dump the database contents to a file
stmt.executeUpdate("backup to backup.db");
}}}

  * Restore the database from a backup file:
{{{
// Create a memory database
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:");
// Restore the database from a backup file
Statement stat = conn.createStatement();
stat.executeUpdate("restore from backup.db");
}}}

Another sample code is [http://code.google.com/p/xerial/source/browse/src/test/java/org/sqlite/BackupTest.java?repo=sqlite here].

== How does SQLiteJDBC work? ==

Our SQLite JDBC driver package (i.e., sqlite-jdbc-(VERSION).jar) contains three types of native SQLite libraries (sqlite-jdbc.dll, sqlite-jdbc.dylib, sqlite-jdbc.so), each of them is compiled for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. An appropriate native library file is automatically extracted into your OS's temporary folder, when your program loads "org.sqlite.JDBC" driver.

== Using SQLiteJDBC with Maven2 ==
If you are familiar with [http://maven.apache.org Maven2], add the following XML fragments into your pom.xml file. With those settings, your Maven will automatically download our SQLiteJDBC library into your local Maven repository, since our sqlite-jdbc libraries are synchronized with the [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/ Maven's central repository]. 

{{{
#!xml
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>
      <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>
      <version>3.6.16</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
}}}

== Using SQLiteJDBC with Tomcat6 Web Server ==
Do not include sqlite-jdbc-(version).jar in WEB-INF/lib folder of your web application package, since multiple web applications hosted by the same Tomcat server cannot load the sqlite-jdbc native library more than once. That is the specification of JNI (Java Native Interface). You will observe UnsatisfiedLinkError exception with the message "no SQLite library found".

Work-around of this problem is to put sqlite-jdbc-(version).jar file into (TOMCAT_HOME)/lib directory, in which multiple web applications can share the same native library file (.dll, .dylib, .so) extracted from this sqlite-jdbc jar file.

If you are using Maven for your web application, set the dependency scope as 'provided', and manually put the SQLite JDBC jar file into (TOMCAT_HOME)/lib folder.
{{{
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>
      <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>
      <version>3.6.16</version>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
}}}

== Build from Source ==

If your OS is not supported, consider to build the [#SourceCodes source] from scratch. 

  * Install Java SDK (1.5 or higher) http://java.sun.com
  * Install [http://mercurial.selenic.com/ Mercurial] (hg)
  * Install Maven2 (2.0.7 or higher) http://maven.apache.org
     * You need to set PATH variable so as to run mvn command. Here is an example setting for maven:
{{{
export MAVEN_HOME=$HOME/local/maven-2.0.7
export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
}}}
  * Clone the Mercurial repository 
{{{ 
 hg clone https://sqlite.xerial.googlecode.com/hg/ sqlite-jdbc
}}}
  * (If necessary) set the JAVA_HOME environment variable as your JDK folder (e.g. /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_13), and PATH so that you can run the javac command.
{{{
 > export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_13/; export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
 > javac -version
 javac 1.5.0_13
}}}
  * Type make in the sqlite-jdbc folder:
{{{
 > make 
}}}
  * A new SQLite JDBC jar file that additionally supports your OS will be generated as target/sqlite-jdbc-(version).jar

=== Dependency Tests ===
 * Windows XP (32-bit)
   * dependency check
{{{
> DUMPBIN /DEPENDENTS sqlitejdbc.dll

  KERNEL32.dll
  msvcrt.dll
}}}
 * Mac OS X (10.4.10 Tiger ~ 10.5 Leopard)
